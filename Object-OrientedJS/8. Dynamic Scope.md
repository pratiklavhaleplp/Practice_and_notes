- Dynamic scope is a model where scopes are determined dynamically at runtime rather then stastically at author time (Where developer had written the code).
    ```
    function testing1(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    function testing2(){
        var a = 10;
        testing1();
    }
    var a = 20;
    testing2();

    <!-- output -->
    20

    Discussion: Eventhough testing1 has been called inside testing2 function still the value of "a" would be equal to 20 the reason is testing1 is in global scope and inside global scope and it is not having "a" inside it's own function scope it'll go to outer scope and halts at "var a = 20" and hence the output is 20. Which shows that javascript is lexically scoped language and this is how lexical lookups finds the identifier.


    But let's assume javascript is not a lexically scoped language it's a dynamically scoped, then the output would be 10, which is getting assigned at runtime inside testing2 function.
    ```
- So javascript is a lexically scoped language PLAIN AND SIMPLE. But we have **"this"** concept in javascript which is indeed related to dynamic scopping. 
- LEXICAL scope says where was the function declared, and DYNAMIC scope says from where the function got called.
