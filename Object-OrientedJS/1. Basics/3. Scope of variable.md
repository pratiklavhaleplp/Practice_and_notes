### Scope of a variable
- One of the most important feature of a language is to store varibales and retrive information from them, later if you want to modify the values then also we would be able to do this, such behaviour gives state to your program.
- In most of the programming languages the code goes through three steps
    1. Tokenizing/Lexing- Creating tokens out of your source code.
    2. Parsing- Takes the token and creates a well defined gramatical structured tree of tokens called as (Abstract Syntax Tree) AST
    3. Code Generation- Process of taking AST and converting it into executable code.
    **There are multiple steps involved in the process of taking your source code and converting it into executable code, and the study of all the processes are beyond the scope of discussion. But for simplicity will say that your javascript code will compile first and then get executed on browser or on node compiler.**
- Understanding scopes with the help of **CONVERSATION**. Who are the spoke persons in the conversation? ENGINE, COMPILER, SCOPE.
    - Defining ENGINE, COMPILER, SCOPE
        - ENGINE- Responsible for compilation from start to finish and execution of your code.
        - COMPILER- One of ENGINE'S friend which handels all the dirty work of parsing an dcode generation.
        - SCOPE- Another fried of ENGINE which collects and maintains the look-up list of all the declared variables and enforces a strict set of rules which specifies how these variables are accessible to current executing code.
    - We will start with below example
        ```
        var a = 2;
        ```
    At first compiler will perform lexing and will create a set of tokens. And Will start conversation with scope.
    - ***COMPILER to SCOPE***: Hey SCOPE do we have variable with name a for current execution context? *If yes then compiler ignores and moves further otherwise* COMPILER *will ask scope to declare a varible with name "a" for that execution context.* Later compiler will produce code for ENGINE to handel assignment a = 2.
    - ***ENGINE to SCOPE***: Hey SCOPE do we have variable called "a" in the current execution scope? *If yes ENGINE will use the variable otherwise ENGINE will look elsewhere.* At the end ENGINE will assign value 2 to "a" varibale if ENGINE never finds "a" then he will yell out error that would be **Reference Error**.
    - To summarize two distinct actions are taken for assigning a variable with value 2. First is check in the scope do we have variable or not, Second is if variable is there then assign a value to it.
- **LHS and RHS LookUP's**: Now we have understanding that after putting/declaring one variable compiler generates the code and hand it over to the ENGINE for performing next operation.
    - ENGINE will now starts the search for the variable in the scope which is called as variable LookUp. we have two main types of LookUp's.
        1. LHS [Happens while function/objects/identifiers are ***DECLARED IN CODE***.]
        2. RHS [Happens while functions/objects/identifiers are ***UTILIZED IN CODE***.]
    - Example:
        ```
        L1.    function test(a){
        L2.        console.log(a);
        L3.    }
        L4.    test(2);

        <!-- Explanation -->
        At L1 Engine will do LHS lookup.[Engine-to-Scope hey scope do we have test function if not then create and add it in the execution context.]

        At L2 Engine will do RHS lookup [Engine-to-Scope hey scope do we have a if yes then give me if not then i'll check else where. At the end if Engine fails to get the variable from scope then it'll yell a "Reference Error"].

        At L4 Engine will do RHS lookup for test function. [Engine-to-Scope hey scope do we have test if yes then give me if not then i'll check else where. At the end if Engine fails to get the variable from scope then it'll yell a "Reference Error"]

        At L4 Engine will do RHS for parameter assignment of 2 inside test function. There is implicit 
        "a = 2" assignment while calling test function.
        ```

- **Nested Scope** If we have multiple scopes defined inside a existing scope then we have nested scopes in our code.
    - Example:
        ```
        function test1(){
            var a = 10, b = 10;
            function test2(){
                var c = 10;
                console.log('value of a is :', a, 'value of b is :', b);
            }
            test2();
        }
        test1();

        <!-- output -->
        value of a is : 10 value of b is : 10
        ```
