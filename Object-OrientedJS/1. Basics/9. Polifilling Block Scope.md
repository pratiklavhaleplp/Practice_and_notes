- We can create block scopes by using **"catch clause"** and **"with"** it has been there from ES3.
- Now after ES6 with the introduction of **"let"** we have full block scoping capability in javascript.
- Consider below examples
    ```
    <!-- With ES6 -->
    {
        let a = 2;
        console.log(a);
    }
    console.log(a);

    <!-- output -->
    2
    Reference Error
    ```
    ```
    <!-- We acheived here block scoping even without let -->
    {
        try{
            throw undefined;
        }catch(a){
            a = 2;
            console.log(a);
        }
    }
    console.log(a);
    
    <!-- output -->
    2
    Reference Error


    Descussion: In this example catch block is providing block scoping to variable a, which means that we can use it as polyfill for acheiving block scoping in pre ES6 environments.
