### Scope of a variable
- For initial discussion we are considering let and const declaration of a variables. We will introduce var in greater details.
- There are only **three types** of scope present in javascript 
    - **program/ global**
    - **block**
    - **function**
- For dealing with scope lets start from basics. We know that we can define variable with the help of **let**, **var** and **const** in Javascript. Those are the **only three options** we have in Javascript.
- Variables defined in the **GLOBAL SCOPE** accessibility.
    - Note - Variables declared **INSIDE GLOBAL** are **accessible** in **FUNCITON AND BLOCK SCOPE**
        ```
        let global = 'global';
        globalWithoutName = 'globalWithoutName';
        console.log('global named let from Global Scope : ', global);
        console.log('un named global from Global Scope : ', globalWithoutName);

        if(true){
            // Block Scope
            console.log('global named let from Block Scope : ', global);
            console.log('un-named global from Block Scope : ', globalWithoutName);
        }

        function testing(){
            // Function Scope
            console.log('global named let from Function Scope : ', global);
            console.log('un-named global Function Scope : ', globalWithoutName);
        }
        testing();

        Output: 
        global named let from Global Scope :  global
        un-named globale from Global Scope :  globalWithoutName
        global named let from Block Scope :  global
        un-named globale from Block Scope :  globalWithoutName
        global named let from Function Scope :  global
        un-named global Function Scope :  globalWithoutName
        ```
    - Note- Check variable *globalWithoutName* we created this variable without let, var and const. In Javascript we can do such variable declaration. ***globalWithoutName*** is called as implicit global variables in javascript, such declarations is not recommended as it will lead to naming conflicts and you woun't be able to find for which purpose we have created this variable. 
- Variables defined in the **BLOCK SCOPE** accessibility. 
    - Note - Variables declared **inside block** are **not accessible** in **GLOBAL SCOPE**
        ```
        if(true){
        let blockVar = 'Block Var';
        }
        console.log('Inside global scope :',blockVar); // ERROR AT THIS LINE
        function testing(){
            console.log('Inside Function scope : ',blockVar);
        }
        testing();
        ```
    - Note - Variables declared **inside block** are **not accessible** in **FUNCTION SCOPE**
        ```
        if(true){
        let blockVar = 'Block Var';
        }
        function testing(){
            console.log('Inside Function scope : ',blockVar); // ERROR AT THIS LINE
        }
        testing();
        ```
- Variables defined in the **FUNCTION SCOPE** accessibility.
    - Note - Variables declared **inside function** are not accessible in **BLOCK SCOPE**
        ```
        function testing(){
            let functionVariable = 'Inside function';
        }
        if(true){
            console.log(functionVariable);// ERROR AT THIS LINE
        }
        ```
    - Note - Variables declared **inside function** are not accessible in **GLOBAL SCOPE**
        ```
        function testing(){
            let functionVariable = 'Inside function';
        }
        console.log(functionVariable);// ERROR AT THIS LINE
        ```
- As we know out program runs in **Global** execution context. Each and every **funciton/block** will work inside the global execution context. There are two scenarios we have to cover.
-  ***Variables defined in the respective sope are accessible in their own scope***.
- A **variable** which is defined **inside the block** is **accessible within the block**.
- A **variable** which is defined **inside the function** is **accessible within the function**.

- Variable **Hoisting**  ***(check variable-hoisting.js)***
    ```
    function testing(){
    alert(a); // undefined THIS IS CALED AS VARIABLE HOISTING. HAPPENS ONLY WHEN WE ARE USING VAR 
    var a = 10;
    alert(a);
    }
    testing();
    ```
    - Note- In above example you will be getting **undefined** in the alert box which shows that when **javascript executes your code** all **the variables which are declared with var keyword are hoisted at the top of the function** hence **before declaring** **"a"** we are getting **undefined** and **after declaration** inside alert we are getting **"10"** value.
