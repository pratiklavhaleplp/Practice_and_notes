- **For-of** loop
    ```
    const arr = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six'];
    for(const ele of arr){
        console.log(ele);
    } 

    <!-- output -->
    one
    two
    three
    four
    five
    six
    ```
- **Iterators and Iterables** 
    - **Iterators** Javascript iterator is an object which exposes next() method. This method will return you next item from the collection in the form of Object which has two properties "done" and "value"
        ```
        function iter(array){
            let nextId = 0;
            return{
                next: function(){
                    if(nextId < array.length){
                        return {value : array[nextId++], done : false};
                    }else{
                        return {done : true}
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        let it = iter(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']);
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());
        console.log(it.next());

        <!-- output -->
        { value: 'one', done: false }
        { value: 'two', done: false }
        { value: 'three', done: false }
        { value: 'four', done: false }
        { value: 'five', done: false }
        { value: 'six', done: false }
        { done: true }
        
        ```
    - **Iterables** is the object which defines it's iteration behaviour. Foran object to be a iterable it should implement method @@iterator, meaning the object mush have **'Symbol.iterator'** as a key.
        ```
        let itr = {
            0: "zero",
            1: "one",
            2: "two",
            3: "three",
            4: "four",
            5: "five",
            length: 6,
            [Symbol.iterator](){
                let index = 0;
                return {
                    next : ()=>{
                        let value = this[index];
                        let done = index > this.length;
                        index++;
                        return { value, done };
                    }
                };
            }   
        }
        for(let ele of itr){
            console.log(ele);
        }
        ```
- **Generators** In languages where multiThreading is supported such flow of execution can partially finish the task that has been in progress. Like a function can be executed partially in case of multi threading. As Javascript is single threadded Language we don't need to worry about such scenarios.
    - Generator functions chooses to pause by itself, it can not be paused by external code. During execution fuunctino used "yeild" to pause the execution.
    - Once the generator function is paused it can be resumed back by code which is outside the function.
    - You can pause and resume the generator function as many times you want.
    - A popular pattern with generator function is to write a infinite loop and pause or resume the function as an when required.
    - Another important feature of generator functions is that they allow two-way message passing in and out of it.
    - When ever you pause the function with the help of yeild the message is sent out of the generator function, and when the funciton is resumend the message is passed back to the generator function.
        ```
        function* generaterTest(){
            console.log("1");
            yield;
            console.log("2");
        }

        const generatorObj = generaterTest();
        console.log(generatorObj.next());
        console.log(generatorObj.next());

        <!-- output -->
        1
        { value: undefined, done: false }
        2
        { value: undefined, done: true }
        ```
