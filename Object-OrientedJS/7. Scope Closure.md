- **Screte** closure is all around you in the javascript you just have to recognize it and embrace it.
- Closure is not a syntax/tool in javascript that you need to learn you have to understand it that's it.
- All over your code you create closures and you did not know them, you need not to create them intentionally and use them in your code.
- **So What is closure**? Closure is when a function is able to remember and access it's lexical scope even when that function is executing outside it's lexical scope.
    ```
    function foo(){
        <!-- lexical scope of foo -->

        var a = 2;
        function bar(){
            <!-- lexical scope of bar -->

            console.log(a);
        }
        return bar;
    }
    <!-- Global Scope -->
    var baz = foo();
    baz();

    Discussion: baz() is getting executed in global lexical scope. "a" variable is declared in foo lexical scope as per function scope and garbage collection all the variables inside foo should get garbage collected once the execution of foo gets completed in our code we did that at "var baz = foo()". 

    Now as per defination CLOSURE is observed when function is capable of remembering and accessing it's lexically scoped variables out-side it's own lexical scope.
    OR
    We can say we have created closure of a in our example.
    ```
    - Any of the way where functions can be passed around as values and indeed invoked at another locations are all examples of **observing/exercising closures.**
    - Whatever facility we use to transport an inner function outside of its lexical scope, it will maintain a scope reference to where it was originally declared, and wherever we execute them, there closure will be ex‚Äêercised.
- There are multiple code patterns which laverages the power of closures. We will discuss **MODULE** pattern. There are two requirements of module pattern.
    1. There must be a outer function and that must be invoked at least once.
    2. The enclosing function must expose one inner function, so that this inner function has closure over the private scope, and can access and/or modify that private state.

    ```
    var test = (function enclosingFun(){
        var something = "cool";
        var another = [1, 2, 3];
        
        function doSomething(){
            console.log(something);
        }

        function doAnother(){
            console.log(another.join("!"));
        }

        return {
            doSomething, doAnother
        }
    })();
    test.doSomething();
    test.doAnother();
    ```
