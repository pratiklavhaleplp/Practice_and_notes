### Classes and modules.
- Javascript is a prototype based language and we can manage inheritance with the help of prototypes.
- Classes in the javascript are syntactic sugar for prototypes.
    ```
    <!-- Creating inheritance among person employee and engineer with prototype. -->
    let Person = function (firstName) {
        if (!(this instanceof Person))
            throw new Error('Person is a constructor');
        this.firstName = firstName;
    };

    Person.prototype.giveBirth = function(){
        // dummy code just added giveBirth function.
    };

    let Employee = function(firstName, lastName, job){
        if (!(this instanceof Employee))
            throw new Error('Employee is a constructor');
        Person.call(this, firstName);
        this.job = job;
    }

    // creating a object of type Person and assigning it to Employee.prototype.
    Employee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
    Employee.prototype.startJob = function() {
        // ...Employee starts job
    };

    let Engineer = function(firstname, lastname, job, department) {
        if (!(this instanceof Engineer)) {
            throw new Error("Engineer is a constructor");
        }
        Employee.call(this, firstname, lastname, job);
        this.department = department;
    };

    // creating a object of type Employee and assigning it to Engineer.prototype.
    Engineer.prototype = Object.create(Employee.prototype);

    Engineer.prototype.startWorking = function() {
           // ...Engineer starts working
       };
    let pratikEng = new Engineer('pratik', 'lavhale', 'codding', 'CSE');
    console.log(`name is : ${pratikEng.firstName}`);
    console.log(`last name is : ${pratikEng.lastName}`);
    console.log(`job is : ${pratikEng.job}`);
    console.log(`department is : ${pratikEng.department}`);

    <!-- output -->
    name is : pratik
    last name is : undefined
    job is : codding
    department is : CSE
    ```
    ```
     <!-- Creating inheritance among person employee and engineer with classes. -->
    class Person {
        constructor(firstName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
        };

        giveBirth() {
            // dummy function.
        }
    };

    class Employee extends Person {
        constructor(firstName, lastName, job){
            super(firstName);
            this.lastName = lastName;
            this.job = job;
        }

        startJob(){
            // dummy function.
        }
    }

    class Engineer extends Employee {
        constructor(firstName, lastName, job, department){
            super(firstName, lastName, job);
            this.department = department;
        }

        startWorking(){
            // dummy function.
        }
    }

    let pratikEng = new Engineer('pratik', 'lavhale', 'codding', 'CSE');
    console.log(`name is : ${pratikEng.firstName}`);
    console.log(`last name is : ${pratikEng.lastName}`);
    console.log(`job is : ${pratikEng.job}`);
    console.log(`department is : ${pratikEng.department}`);

    <!-- output -->
    name is : pratik
    last name is : lavhale
    job is : codding
    department is : CSE
    ```
- **Static methods in class**
    ```
    class Test{
        static logOutPut(){
            console.log('logging output...');
        }
    };

    let test = new Test();
    console.log(Test.logOutPut());
    console.log(test.logOutPut());// Error logOutput is not a function
    ```
- **Use of Supper**
    ```
    class Parent{
        constructor(name){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = 15;
        }
        parentMethod1(){
            console.log('parentMethod1');
        }

        parentMethod2(){
            console.log('parentMethod2');
        }
    }

    class Child extends Parent{
        constructor(firstName, childName){
            super(firstName);
            this.childName = childName;
        }

        childMethod1(){
            super.parentMethod1();
            // need to think on this.
            console.log(super.age);
        }
    };

    let ch = new Child('Prabhudas', 'pratik');
    let pr = new Parent('ABC', 'PQR');
    pr.age = 20;
    console.log('parent age is : ',pr.age);
    console.log('child age is: ',ch.age);

    // unable to access super.age
    ch.childMethod1();

    <!-- output -->
    parent age is :  20
    child age is:  15
    parentMethod1
    undefined


    Discussion: All the properties and methods gets inherited to child object age is seprate for child and parent.

    You should keep the shared methods always static.
    ```

- **Mixins** If you want to inherit properties and methods from two different classes then such sceanrios/patterns are called Mixins.
    ```
    class Person{}
    class Employee extends Person{}

    class BackgroundVerification{
        check(){}
    }
    class OnBoard{
        pintBadge(){}
    }

    
    Discussion: Both background checks and onboarding classes are the templates and there functionality will be used multiple times. Such templates are called as Mixins.
    ```
    - **Applying mixins**
        ```
        class Person{
            constructor(name){
                this.name = name;
            }
        }
        const BackGroundCheck = Tools => class extends Tools{
            check(){
                console.log("checking background");
            }
        }

        const Onboard = Tools => class extends Tools{
            printBadge(){
                console.log('printing badge');
            }
        }

        class Employee extends BackGroundCheck(Onboard(Person)){
            
        }
        ```
    - **Try to implement Mixins with functions**

- **Modules** ES6 offers built in modules.
    - What ever code you have written to the module is local to the module unless you try to export it.
    - You might be having multiple functions inside your modules and want to export few of them you can do it with multiple ways. 
    - check how we have created modules with the help of .mjs files.
    - One major question to ask how ReactModule works and why we are not using .mjs files in react, why we are simple importing and exporting with the help of js files. Is react a module which internally handel this?
    - **Important points**
        - Modules are singleton eventhough you are importing multiple times your variables or functions a **Module** will get imported only once.
        - **varibales, functions** and other type of declaration are loacal to the module.
        - Only declarations **marked with export** are available outside the **module** for import.
        - **Modules** can import from other modules
            - you can use relative path or absolute path
            - you can drop **.js** while importing if you are already inside the module just like a react as per my consideration this needs to checked properly.
    - **Export List** Instead of exporting eact and every declaration you can export the delaration with the help of one single obj.
        ```
        export {test, variable}
        ```
    - Importing with other names
        ```
        import {test as test_demo};
        ```
