### Prototype
- Understnding prototype is important as we know javascript is classified as having prototype-based object model.
    ***just check what are the different types we cah store data and do we have prototype proeprty in them***
        - let obj = {};
        - arrow funcitons
        - functions
        - arrays
        - variables
        - just check who can give us prototype in javascript?
            - as of now i have checked that functions and classes has this prototype property.
- **The prototype property** Functions in the javascript are Objects and there are multiple properties we can call on Objects.
    ```
    let arrowFun = () =>{
        console.log('arrow funciton...');
    }
    
    Discussion: arrowFun has below properties
        - length
        - name
        - __defineGetter__
        - __defineSetter__
        - __lookupGetter__
        - __lookupSetter__
        - __proto__
        - call
        - apply
        - bind
        - constructor
        - hasOwnProperty
        - isPrototypeOf
        - propertyIsEnumerable
        - toLocaleString
        - toString
        - valueOf
    ```
    ```
    function testing(){
        console.log('testing');
    }
    

    Discussion: testing has below properties.
        - length
        - name
        - prototype
        - __defineGetter__
        - __defineSetter__
        - __lookupGetter__
        - __lookupSetter__
        - __proto__
        - call
        - apply
        - bind
        - constructor
        - hasOwnProperty
        - isPrototypeOf
        - propertyIsEnumerable
        - toLocaleString
        - toString
        - valueOf
    ```
    - Key difference between arrow function and function declared with function keywoed is that we have prototype in the function which has been created with the help of function keyword.
