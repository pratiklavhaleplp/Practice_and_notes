- Creating a object.
    ```
    var test = {}; -> will create a empty object.
    var test = {
        name : "pratik",
        age : "27"
    }; -> will create a object with name and age property. 
    ```
    ```
    var test = {};
    console.log(typeof test === "object");
    console.log(typeof test);

    <!-- output -->
    true
    object
    ```
- Adding new properties to object.
    ```
    var test = {};
    test.name = "pratik";
    test.age = "27";
    console.log(test);

    <!-- output -->
    { name: 'pratik', age: '27' }
    ```
- Deleting existing property.
    ```
    var test = {};
    test.name = "pratik";
    test.age = "27";
    delete test.name;
    delete test.name;
    console.log(test);

    <!-- output -->
    { age: '27' }

    Discussion: You must have noticed that delete operator is not throwing any error as we are deleting "name" property twice. For the first instance it's ok property is there but next time also delete is not throwing any error, that is the nature of delete operator.
    ```
- Using this in the object
    ```
    let test = {
    name: "pratik",
    innerTest : {
        name: "rutvik",
        fullName: function(){
            console.log(this.name + " " + "lavhale");
            }
        }
    }
    test.innerTest.fullName();

    <!-- output -->
    rutvik lavhale

    Discussion: We are using "this" inside innerTest object which is nested inside test object hence we are getting reference of innerTest in "this".
    ```
- Cunstructor functions
    ```
    function UserInfo(){
    this.name = 'pratik';
    this.address = 'gadge nagar';
    }
    let rutvikInfo = new UserInfo();
    rutvikInfo.name = 'rutvik';
    rutvikInfo.address = 'gadge nagar';
    rutvikInfo.age = '24';
    let defaultUser = new UserInfo();
    console.log('default UserInfo is : ', defaultUser);
    console.log('rutvik UserInfo is : ', rutvikInfo);

    <!-- output -->
    default UserInfo is :  UserInfo { name: 'pratik', address: 'gadge nagar' }
    rutvik UserInfo is :  UserInfo { name: 'rutvik', address: 'gadge nagar', age: '24' }


    Discussion: UserInfo is a constructor function by default if you are creating a object through this then you will get 
        UserInfo { name: 'pratik', address: 'gadge nagar' } OBJECT

    If you are creating a new object as we have created rutvikInfo and assign new values to it then new values will get assigned and you will get a object in the memory it's not a reference its a object created with new memory space. New rutvikInfo object will look like.
        UserInfo { name: 'rutvik', address: 'gadge nagar', age: '24' } OBJECT
    age is a new property that we can add if required with the help of "." operator.

    - You can not create a constructor function with the help of arrow operator.

    - Inside constructor function the value of this is refering to current function i.e, it would be empty object. And a function becomes a constructor function if you are creating a instance of function with the help of "new" operator.

    Please follow proper naming conventions while creating constructor functions you should make UpperCase first character of your constructor function.
    ```
    ```
    function userInfo() {
    console.log('this here is : ', this);
    this.name = 'pratik';
    this.address = 'gadge nagar';
    }
    userInfo();

    <!-- Output -->
    this here is [WINDOW OBJECT]


    Discussion: Above funtion is not a constructor function as we have not created a instance with the help of new keyword.
    ```
    ```
    function userInfo() {
    console.log('this here is : ', this);
    this.name = 'pratik';
    this.address = 'gadge nagar';
    }
    userInfo();
    let rutvikInfo = new userInfo();

    <!-- Output -->
    this here is : [WINDOW OBJECT]
    this here is :  userInfo {}
    userInfo { name: 'pratik', address: 'gadge nagar' }


    Discussion: At first we have only called userInfo function there it is normal javascript funtion, now after using new with the userInfo for that line it is working as constructor function.
    ```
- **The Global Object**. The host environment(browser, node, etc) provides a global object and that global object provides multiple important properties. you can access global object with the help of **"this"** operator outside any constructor function or outside any function.
    ```
    <!-- We are using host here browser -->
    var a = 1;
    console.log(window.a);
    console.log(this.a);

    <!-- output -->
    1
    1
    ```
- The **Constructor** property
    ```
    function userInfo(name = '', age = ''){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    }
    let pratik = new userInfo('pratik', '27');
    let rutvik = new pratik.constructor('rutvik', '24');

    console.log('Constructor', pratik.constructor);
    console.log('Pratik object', pratik);
    console.log('Rutvik object', rutvik);

    <!-- output -->
    Constructor [Function: userInfo]
    Pratik object userInfo { name: 'pratik', age: '27' }
    Rutvik object userInfo { name: 'rutvik', age: '24' }


    Discussion: When you create a object with the constructor function that object has a property called "constructor". "constructor" property has the reference of your CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION(userInfo) check how we have created rutvik object.
    ```
- **instanceOf Operator**
    ```
    function userInfo(name = "", age = ""){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    }
    let pratik = new userInfo("pratik", "27");
    console.log('is pratik instance of userInfo? ', pratik instanceof userInfo);

    <!-- output -->
    is pratik instance of userInfo true


    Discussion: instaceof will return true or false please check above example carefully.
    ```

- **Functions that returns Object**
    ```
    function userInfo(name = "", age = "") {
    return {
        name: name,
        age: age
        }
    }
    let pratikInfo = userInfo("pratik", "27");
    console.log("pratik info is : ", pratikInfo);
    console.log("constructor of pratik is", pratikInfo.constructor);
    console.log("is pratik instance of userInfo? ", pratikInfo instanceof userInfo);

    <!-- output -->
    pratik info is :  { name: 'pratik', age: '27' }
    constructor of pratik is [Function: Object]
    is pratik instance of userInfo?  false


    Discussion: every time you call the function it'll return you a new new object. Check carefully what instanceof and constructor properties are used in the code.
    ```
- **Passing objects**
    ```
    let testObj = {
        name: "pratik",
        age: "27"
    }
    function test(obj){
        console.log('Received object is ', obj);

        // modifying testObj here
        obj.age = "40";
    }
    test(testObj);
    console.log(testObj);

    <!-- output -->
    Received object is  { name: 'pratik', age: '27' }
    { name: 'pratik', age: '40' }

    Discussion: testObj is passed by reference. So if you made any modificaiton in the object then it'll get reflected to the orignal object.
    ```
- **Comparing Objects** If you are comparing two objects and if they are refering to same object then and then only **"==="** will yeil true else it will yeild false.
    ```
    let pratik = {
    age: 27,
    address: "gadge nagar"
    };
    let pratikClone = {
        age: 27,
        address: "gadge nagar"
    };

    if(pratik === pratikClone){
        console.log("equal");
    }else{
        console.log("not equal")
    }

    <!-- output -->
    not equal


    Discussion: The reason for not equal is, pratik and pratikClone are not refering to same object.
    ```
- **Object literals**
    ```
    let a = 1, b = 2;
    let objOld = {a: a, b: b};
    let objNew = { a, b};
    console.log('Old object',objOld);
    console.log('New object',objNew);

    <!-- output -->
    Old object { a: 1, b: 2 }
    New object { a: 1, b: 2 }


    Discussion: Both the ways we can create objects. We are creating objects just by giving key values which is way we create objects with literals. 
    ```
    ```
    let obj = {
    name: "pratik",
    test(){
        console.log('testing');
        }
    }
    obj.test();

    <!-- output -->
    testing


    Discussion: we added function in the object obj without using function keyword.
    ```
- **Object properties and attributes** Each Object can have properties or it might be the empty object. If Object is having properties then each property in the object has two attributes.
    - Enumerable(boolean): Indicates that you properties can be itterate or not with the help of Object.keys
    - Configurable(bolean): If false then you can not delete or modify any property in the object.
    ```
    let userInfo = {
        name : "pratik",
        age : 27
    }
    cosole.log(userInfo.Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(userInfo, 'name'));

    <!-- output -->
    {
    value: 'pratik',
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
    }


    Discussion: So here we have userInfo object inside it we have name property and we can configure and  enumerate this name property.
    ```
    ```
    let userInfo = {
    name: "pratik",
    age: 27,
    address: {
        pin: 444603
        }
    }
    Object.defineProperty(userInfo, 'name', { configurable: false, writable: false, enumerable: true });
    Object.defineProperty(userInfo, 'address', { configurable: false, writable: false, enumerable: true });
    userInfo.name = "rutvik";
    console.log('userInfo is : ', userInfo);

    <!-- output -->
    userInfo is :  { name: 'pratik', age: 27, address: { add: 'gadgeNagar' } }


    Discussion: If you could see we have changed the name property but it did not got updated because we have set writable as "false" which makes the name property not to change in any scenario.
    ```

- **ES6 Object methods** Es6 introduces **static methods for objects**. Object.assign is a helper method which will help us to shallow copy the object properties.
    - **Object.assign** This is a static method check the upper case of "Object"
        ```
        let userInfo = {};
        Object.assign(userInfo, { name: "pratik" });
        console.log('Added one property name to the target Obj [userInfo]: ',userInfo);

        Object.assign(userInfo, { age: 27 }, { address: { pin: 444603, landMark: "gadge nagar" } });
        console.log('Added properties from multiple source and target Obj is [userInfo]: ',userInfo);

        <!-- output -->
        Added one property name to the target Obj [userInfo]:  { name: 'pratik' }
        Added properties from multiple source and target Obj is [userInfo]:  {
        name: 'pratik',
        age: 27,
        address: { pin: 444603, landMark: 'gadge nagar' }
        }

        
        Discussion: We added properties or assigned proeprties to out Target object userInfo. We can have multiple source objects and one source object please check 2nd Object.assign method where we have added address and age carefully.
        ```
        - **Only Enumerable own (non-inherited) properties can be copied using Object.assign(). Properties from Prototype chain are not considered while adding property using Object.assign method.**
            ```
            let userInfo = { age: 27 };
            Object.defineProperty(userInfo, 'address', {enumerable : true});
            console.log('Enumurable set to true: ',userInfo);

            <!-- output -->
            Enumurable set to true:  { age: 27, address: undefined }


            Discussion: Carefully check the output we are making enumerable as true because of same reason we are getting address in the userInfo object such "object's" property are considered in Object.assign
            ```
            ```
            let userInfo = { age: 27 };
            Object.defineProperty(userInfo, 'address', {enumerable : false});
            console.log('Enumurable set to true: ',userInfo);

            <!-- output -->
            Enumurable set to true:  { age: 27 }


            Discussion: Carefully check the output we are making enumerable as false because of same reason we are not getting address in the userInfo object such "object's" property are not considered in Object.assign
            ```

    - **Object.is** Compare object with this method.
        ```
        console.log('With === NaN: ',NaN === NaN);
        console.log('With === -0 +0: ',-0 ==== +0);

        console.log('With Object.is NaN: ',Object.is(NaN, NaN));
        console.log('With Object.is -0 +0: ',Object.is(-0,+0));

        <!-- output -->
        With === NaN:  false
        With === -0 +0:  true
        With Object.is NaN:  true
        With Object.is -0 +0:  false


        Discussion: === sometimes may create confussion so Object.is would be best solution for such confussion. Again Object.is does not solve out problem of **deep equality or same content different reference objects**
        ```
        - Check this example.
            ```
            let pratikUserInfo = {
                name: "pratik",
                age: 27
            };
            let defaultUserInfo = {
                name: "pratik",
                age: 27
            };

            if(pratikUserInfo === defaultUserInfo){
                console.log("Both the objects are equal");
            }else{
                console.log("Objects are not equal");
            }

            if(Object.is(pratikUserInfo, defaultUserInfo)){
                console.log("Both the objects are equal with Object.is");
            }else{
                console.log("Objects are not equal with Object.is"); 
            }

            <!-- output -->
            Objects are not equal
            Objects are not equal with Object.is


            Discussion: If you could see over here both the objects are equal but still you are getting both the objects are not equal even with Object.is this is the problem of object equality currently i'm facing. We'll look for the solution on this further.
            ```

- **Desctructuring**
    ```
    let userInfo ={
    name: {
        firstName: "pratik",
        lastName: "lavhale"
    },
    address: "gadge nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati.",
    age: "27"
    }

    let {address : userAddress, age: userAge} = userInfo;
    console.log('address is : ', userAddress);
    console.log('age is : ', userAge);

    <!-- output -->
    address is :  gadge nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati.
    age is :  27


    Discussion: Check carefully how we have destructured address and age we have given local names like userAaddress and userAge and loged them out.
    ```
    ```
    let days = ['mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun'];
    let [, , , thuVar] = days;
    console.log(thuVar);

    <!-- output -->
    thu

    
    Discussion: Check carefully how we have destructured thu here we gave thuVar directly as a local variable name and we have got thu assigned to thuVar.
    ```
