### Promises and Proxies

- Introduction to async programming and how JS is ideal for codding async code.
- Meta programmin with proxies
- **Promises**
  - **Synchronous model** Each task is executed one at a time. If we have three tasks which has no dependency on one another in synchronous model you have to wait till the first task to get completed. This is what synchronous model is.
  - **Threadded model** To solve above problem developers introduced new model called as threadded/ multi-threadded model. In threadded model each task is performed in it's own **thread**. Usually threads are managed by O.S and they can run parallel in different CPU cores or on single core with appropriate sheduling algorithm.
  - **Asynchronous programming model** Multiple tasks are given to sigle thread of control. The Async model is simple because you have only one thread involed into it. This model does not require inter thread communication and hence it is predictable.
  - In sync and async we are having one thread of control. But the main difference between sync and async is that how they handle **blocking processes**.
    - What is this Blocking process?<br>
      A Task performend by CPU or RAM it might be I/O operation on disk or a network call.
  - **Javascript call Stack**

    ```
    function c(z2) {
       console.log(new Error().stack);
    }
    
    function b(z1) {
    c(z1+ 1); 
    }

    function a(z) {
           b(z + 1);
    } 
    
    a(1);

    <!-- output -->
    Error
    at c (<anonymous>:2:20)
    at b (<anonymous>:6:5)
    at a (<anonymous>:10:12)
    at <anonymous>:13:5

    
    Discussion: What this stack indicates that error has been generated at "c" function and "c" has been called from "b" function and "b" has been called from function "a". The stack is important because javascript will know where to return.
    ```

    - **Message Queue** The JS runtime contains the message queue which contains the list of msgs that needs to be processed. These msgs are queued and responds to the events such as click or an http response. Each message is associated with callback function. 

    - **Event Loop** A browser tab runs on a single thread --> an event loop. This loop continiously picks msgs from the message queue and executes the callback associated with them. The event loop simply keeps picking the task and other processes adds messages to the message queue. Other process includes timers and event handlers run in parallel and keep adding tasks to the queue.

    - **Timers** The setTimeout method creates the timer and waits until it fires. When the timer is executed a task gets added to the message queue. The setTimeOut methods takes two arguments one is the callBack function and another is duration. After the duration gets completed the callBack is added to the message queue. Once the it is there on message queue event loop will pick the callback and execute it. There is no guarantee when the callback will get picked up by the eventloop.

    - **Run to Compilation** Once the task/message gets picked up by the eventloop the associate callBack is run to completion. This means that the msg is executed totally before pickingup a new message. This property gives async model predictability. Once the msg gets picked up no other interaction will happen on the browser or we can say that browser will be blocked.

    - **Events** You can register event for an object and receive results of a method asynchronously.
        - sample event handler for XMLHttpRequest API
            ```
            let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhr.open('GET', 'http://babeljs.io', true);
            xhr.onload = function(e) {
                    if (this.status == 200) {
                    console.log("Works");
                } 
            };
            xhr.send(); // adds the response on the message queue.

            
            Discussion: xhr.onload() is the event handler which will get triggered asynchronously when the response is received from the open method.
            ```
    
    - **callbacks** It is a un-named function that will get added to the async method as a last argument.
        ```
        fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', (err, data) => {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log(data);
        });


        Discussion: call-back function has two parameters err and data which will get executed once we get result/response from the readFile method which is asynchronus is nature.
        ```
    - **Promises** ES6 intoduces promises as an alternative to the callback mechanism. Like callback promises are used to get the results form the async function call. Promises are more easy to use and produces more readable code. 
        - A promise object represents a value that may be **available now** or **in future**, or **possibly never**. 
        - A promise has three mutually exclusive(**can be only one**) states 
            1. A promise is **pending** before the result is ready; this is the initial state.
            2. A promise is **fulfilled** when the result is ready.
            3. On an error, a promise is **rejected**.
        - When a **pending** promise is either **fulfilled** or **rejected**, associated callbacks/handlers that are queued up by **then()** method of promise are executed.
            ```
            fs.read('/etc/passwd').
            then(result=>{

            });


            Discussion: The async function result what-ever it would be is noified when result is ready.
            ```
        - chaining aysnc functions.
            ```
            async1(args).
            then(result => {
                return async2(result.args)
            }).
            then(finalResult => {

            }).
            catch(error => {

            });
            ```
        - **Creating promises**
            ```
            const p = new Promise(
                function(resolve, reject){
                    if(){
                       resolve(value); // success 
                    }else{
                        reject(value); // failure 
                    }
                }
            );


            Discussion: Parameter to the Promise is a executer function which takes two parameters resolve and reject
            ```
        - **Using promises for reading file**
            ```
            import {readFile} from 'fs';

            function readFileWithPromise(fileName){
                return new Promise(
                    function(resolve, reject){
                        readFile(fileName, 
                        (error, data) => {
                            if(data)
                                resolve(data);
                            else
                                reject(error);
                        });
                    }
                );
            };

            readFileWithPromise('file.txt').
            then(result => {
                console.log(result);
            }).
            catch(error => {
                console.log(error);
            });
            ```
        - **Promise.all** The Promise.all method takes iterable of promises as an argument. When all of the promisses are fulfilled an array is filled with their results.
            ```
            Promise.all(
                [
                    f1(),
                    f2(),
                    f3()
                ]
            ).
            then(([r1, r2, r3]) => {
                console.log([r1, r2, r3])
            }).
            catch(
                error => {
                    console.log(error);
                }
            );
            ```
- **Meta Programming and Promisses** Meta-programming refers to a methodology of programming where program knows about its structure and can manupulate itself. Many programming languages have this functionality of meta-programming and do this with the help of **macros**. In languages such as **c#** and **java** **reflection** is the form of **meta-programming** because program can examin information about itself using reflection.
    - In javascript you can say **methods of the object** allow you to examin the structure and hence they offer meta programming.
        1. **Introspection**: This gives a read-only access to the internals of a program 
        2. **Self-modification**: This makes structural changes possible to the program 
        3. **Intercession**: This changes language semantics
    - Object.keys() method is the way of introspection in javascript.
        ```
        const introspection = {
            intro: function(){
                console.log('testing');
            }
        };

        for(const key of Object.keys(introspection)){
            console.log(key);
        }
        ```
    - self-modification can be acheived with the help of mutating properties inside the object.
    - However intersession or ability to change the language semantics is something not available in javascript till ES6. Proxies are intoduced to opened up this posibility.
    - **Proxy** You can use proxy to determine the behaviour of the object. A proxy is used to define custom behaviour for basic operation of object such as **loking up a property**, **function invocation** and **assignment**.
        - Proxy needs two parameters 
            1. Handler: For each operation you want to customize, you need a handler function.
            2. Target: When handler does not intercept the operation the target is used as fallback.
        - Proxies example for validating values before setting it to a object.
            ```
            let ageValidator = {
                set: function(obj, prop, value){
                    if(prop === 'age'){
                        if(!Number.isInteger(value))
                            throw new TypeError('The age is not a number');
                        if(value > 100)
                            throw new RangeError('age is out of range');
                        obj[prop] = value;  
                    }
                }
            };

            let p = new Proxy({}, ageValidator);
            p.age = 100;
            console.log(`age is : ${p.age}`);
            console.log(`object is : ${p}`);
            p.age = 'thirty two';
            p.age = 150;


            Discussion: Age validator is the handler which is going to determine the behaviour of the object which is going to get created. what is the behavior of the object "age should not be greater than 100 and it should not be a number"
            ```
        - **Function Traps** there are two operation that can be trapped if the target function is apply and constructor. **We are going to see how method interpretation works**
            ```

            ```
            **we'll discuss this latter**
