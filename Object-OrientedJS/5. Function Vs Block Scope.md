```
function foo(a){
    var b = a * 2;
    function bar(c){
        console.log(a, b, c);
    }
    bar(10);
}
foo(3);
```
- In above example there are three scopes
    1. Global scope having foo function
    2. foo function scope having a, b and bar
    3. bar function scope having c. (not sure about b and c).
- **foo and bar** creates a **scope or a container** in which variables are declared. And we are able to **create** the scope/container because **javascript has function-based scope**. When ever you are declaring a function you are creating a scope for that function. **There are also other ways to create a scope/container we will discruss this later**
- **Scope from function**
    ```
    function foo(){
        var b = 2;
        // code...
        function bar(){
            // code...
        }
        // more code...
        var c = 3;
    }
    ```
    - In Above example declaring foo creates a scope, inside foo you will have a, b, bar and c identifiers all are contained within the foo no matter where you have declared it in the scope.
    - a, b, bar and c identifiers are inside foo hence they are not accessible outside the foo.
    - a, b, c, foo are accessible in bar as it is inside foo.
    - Function scope encourages the idea that all the variables which belongs to the function can be used and reused throught the entirety of the function.
    - So Now you can hide your variables inside a function. The question is why we need this concept of hiding your variables or identifiers inside a function? The answer is because of the design principle called as least privilege Also sometimes called as Least authority or Least exposure.
        ```
        function doSomething(a){
            var result = a + doSomethingElse(a);
            console.log('the result is :', result);
        }
        function doSomethingElse(a){
            return a * 10;
        }
        doSomething(20);
        Output:
        220
        ```
        - In the above example doSomething function doesn't have any idea of doSomethingElse function, that is how you can hide the implementation of and other functions.
- **Collision Avoidance** 
    1. **Wrapping** a code block inside the function
    ```
    function foo() {
    function bar(a) {
        i = 3; // changing the `i` in the enclosing scope's // for-loop
        console.log(a + i);
    }
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        bar(i * 2); // oops, inifinite loop ahead!
    }
    }
    foo();
    // Browser will get hangged you need to restart your system there is no way you can reuse the browser.
    ```
    **Solution to above problem is given below**
    ```
    function foo() {
    function bar(a) {
        i = 3; // changing the `i` in the enclosing scope's // for-loop
        console.log(a + i);
    }
    function testing() {
        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            bar(i * 2); // oops, inifinite loop ahead!
        }
    }
    testing();
    }
    foo();

    // you will get output in this case as we have enclosed for loop's "i" inside the testing function.
    ```
    ***From the above example you might have got the idea how powerful the function scoping is***

    2. **Declaring** global namespace.
    - Mulitple libraries are loaded into your project they will easily collied with each other if not hidden inside there internal private functions and variables.
    - While creating a library we can hide our code including variables, functions, objects inside one namespace given below.
        ```
        var MyReallyCoolLibrary =
        {
            awesome: "stuff", 
            doSomething: function () {
                // ...
            },
            doAnotherThing: function () {
                // ...
            }
        };      
        ```
    
    3. **Module** management
    - Another option for collision avoidance is the more modern **module management** using any of various dependency managers. Using module management no libraries every added any identifiers to the global scope.
    - We need to explicitly import modules into our scope with the help of imports.
- **Functions as scopes**
    - We know that if we wrap our code in function then it hides it's functionalities to the outside code but by doing so we are polluting the global space with functions and also we need to call the function for executing it.
    - We can also create a scope by passing our function as expression to the () and execute it.
    ```
    var a = 20;
    (
        function testing(){
            var a = 10;
            console.log('inside the () scope', a);
        }
    )();
    console.log('from the global scope : ', a);

    As we are passing function to () it is called as function expression and while if someone defines a function it is called as function declaration.
    ```
    - **Function expression can be anonymous but function declaration can not be un-named**

- **Block as scopes** are created with the help of {} braces.
    - If we are using var in the block scope and there is already a varible which has been used declared with the var then the block scope variable will rewrite the exixting variable.
    ```
    var a = 10;
    {
        {
            var a = 20;
        }
        console.log(a);
    }
    console.log(a);
    Output :
    20
    20
    ```
