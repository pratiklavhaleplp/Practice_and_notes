### Inheritance.
- **Inheritance Chaining through prototype** prototype object is just a normal object and it also has a secreate link to it's prototype and so a chain is called as prototype chain.
- **prototype chaining example**
    ```
    function EngineeringCollegeRefrenceBooks() {
        this.referenceBooks = [
            {
                title: 'System design',
                pages: 200
            },
            {
                title: 'data structures',
                pages: 400
            }
        ]
    };

    function EngineeringStudentsNotes() {
        this.notes = [
            {
                title: 'system design by pratik',
                pages: 10
            },
            {
                title: 'data structures by pratik',
                pages: 20
            }
        ]
    };

    function CollegeStudents() {
        this.books = [
            {
                title: 'textbook 1',
                pages: 150
            }
        ]
    };

    EngineeringStudentsNotes.prototype = new EngineeringCollegeRefrenceBooks();
    CollegeStudents.prototype = new EngineeringStudentsNotes();

    let rutvik = new CollegeStudents();

    console.log(`rutvik is a instance of EngineeringStudentsNotes ? : ${rutvik instanceof EngineeringStudentsNotes}`)
    console.log(`rutvik is a instance of EngineeringCollegeRefrenceBooks ? : ${rutvik instanceof EngineeringCollegeRefrenceBooks}`)

    console.log(`rutvik can get : ${rutvik.notes[0].title} notes`);
    console.log(`rutvik can get : ${rutvik.referenceBooks[0].title} refrence book`);

    <!-- output -->

    Discussion: CollegeStudents is getting inhrited from EngineeringStudentsNotes constructor function.
                
                EngineeringStudentsNotes is getting inherited from EngineeringCollegeRefrenceBooks constructor function
    ```
    - **Try to over ride the functionality of parent?????? not done yet....** 
- **Multiple Inheritance** When child inherits from more than two parents.

- **Borrowing a constructor** In this pattern the constructor of the class calls the constructor of parent using either call() or apply() method. This can be called as stealing a constructor or inheritance by borrowing a constructor.
    - call and apply allows you to call a function and pass an object, that **function** should bind your object to **it's** this value. 
        ```
        function Shape(id){
            this.id = id;
        };
        Shape.prototype.name = 'Shape';
        Shape.prototype.toString = function(){
            return `from shape ${this.id}`;
        };

        function Traingle(){
            
            // apply will call the shape constructor.
            Shape.apply(this, arguments);
        };
        Traingle.prototype.name = 'Traingle';

        let t = new Traingle(101);
        console.log(t.name);
        console.log(t.id);

        <!-- output -->
        Traingle
        101
        ```
