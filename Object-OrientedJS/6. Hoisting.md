- **Introduction :** There is a subtle detail on how scope attachments works with the declarations that appeares in various locations witin a scope.
- Examples
    ```
    a = 2;
    var a;
    console.log(a);

    <!-- output -->
    2

    Discussion: Many of developers will think this would be undefined as *var a;* has been declared in the end. However the output is 2.
    ```
    ```
    console.log(a);
    var a = 2;
    <!-- output -->
    undefined

    Discussion: By looking above example developer will think that output would be 2. Some will think that as a is used before declaration hence it will be "Reference error". But both the guess are incorrect the out put is "undefined"
    ```
    - Check both the examples carefully. Now the question is what should we consider first assignment(CHICKEN) or declaration(EGG)? 
        - We know before *execution/interpretation/further process of our code,* our code gets compiled first. And one of the job of COMPILATION is to find and *(alocate/add)* all the declaration of variables with there appropriate scopes. 
        - One thing is FIXED, that all the declaration of variables/functions are processed first, before any part of your code gets executed.
            ```
            var a = 2;

            Discussion: You will think of this is a single statement. But you see through the eyes of javascript then there are two statements 
                var a and a = 2
                var a ==> gets processed in compilation phase.
                a = 2 ==> gets processed in code execution phase.
            ```
        - So all the variable declaration are lifited/HOISTED on the top and the assignments are kept at there place.
        - Hoisting is done pre-scope.
            ```
            function test1(){
                <!-- a is hoisted here -->
                console.log('value is a is : ',a);
                function test2(){
                    <!-- b is hoisted here -->
                    console.log('value of b is : ',b);
                    var b = 10;
                }
                test2();
                var a = 30;
            }
            test1();
            ```
        - Function declaration are hoisted but function expression is not hoisted.
            ```
            test();
            function test(){
                console.log("testing");
            }
            <!-- output -->
            testing.
            ```
            ```
            test(); // TypeError: test is not a function
            var test = function(){
                console.log("testing");
            }

            You will get Type error over here because function expressions are not hoisted only function declaration are hoisted.
                -Why we are getting type error because test is hoisted but value is not yet assigned and hence while calling test() we are checking undefined which is illegal operation.
            ```

- **Function First:** Funcitons are hoisted first then variables are hoisted.
    ```
    test();
    function test(){
        console.log("one");
    }
    var test = function(){
        console.log("two");
    }
    
    <!-- output -->
    one

    Discussion: funtion is hoisted first then variables, or we can say functions have more priority then variables if both are having same name.
