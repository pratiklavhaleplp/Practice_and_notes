### **Positioning** 
- The idea of positioning is simple, to attach element to a specific position **where you want it not where default positioning is.**
- **position**: **static | relative | sticky | absolute | fixed** by default it is **static**
    - **static** The element box generated is normal here. Each and every element is static by default.
    - **relative**
