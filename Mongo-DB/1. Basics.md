- What is MongoDB? It is a data base server which helps you to run databases on it. Also capable of creating multiple databses. Inside database we can have multiple collections and multiple documents.
    - Data inside documents are shema-less objects might get differed.
    - You can create nested objects in the mongoDB which helps us to maintain the relation ships between the data. In Sql you need to use joins but here in mongo everything will come inside one document itself.
    - In MongoDB we don't need to maintain multiple collections as we were having multiple tables in sql.
    - Everything will get managed with the help of one collection and in the background mongoDB will effeciently query you data and get back to you with the results.
- MongoDB EcoSystem.
    - MongoDB database
    - Atlas cloud solution
    - Mobile devices (storing mongoDB directly on mobile and used it when required)
    - Compass (allows you to see your data with userInterface).
    - BI connectors 
    - MongoDB charts
- Bascis of MongoDB
    - MongoDB instance can run multiple databases together.
    - Each database has set of collections.
    - Each collections has set of documents.
    - To run your mongoDB instance on another port we can use
        ```
        sudo mongod --port 20718

        After running on different port 
        mongo --port 20718 is required as you have started mongoDB on new port

        By default mongo port is 20717.
        ```
- **CRUD Operation**
    - Your shell is interacting with the MongoDB server and from that you are adding/updating/deleting/reading the data.
    - **Create**
        - insertOne(data, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.insertOne({userName: 'baba', age: 58, address: 'Gadge Nagar'});
            ```
        - insertMany(data, options)
            ```
            db.collection.insertMany(
                [
                    {
                        userName: "pratik",
                        age: 27,
                        address: "Gadge Nagar"
                    },
                    {
                        userName: "ankita",
                        age: 29,
                        address: "Gadge Nagar"
                    },
                    {
                        userName: "rutvik",
                        age: 23,
                        address: "Gadge Nagar"
                    }
                ]
            );


            Discussion: insertMany will require array for adding multiple documents.
            ```

    - **Read**
        - find(filter, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.find().pretty();
            db.userInfo.fing({userName: 'baba'}).pretty();
            

            Discussion: we have passed {userName: 'baba'} in the filters this will fetch unique record from the document list. pretty() method is going to make your response appear in proper json format. 
            ```
        - findOne(filter, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.findOne({address: 'Gadge Nagar'});


            Disussion: We have multiple documents with address equal to 'Gadge Nagar'. findOne will only return first document that it finds while search.
            ```
    
    - **Update** 
    *$set is required in updateOne, updateMany and replaceOne if you are not using it then you will get the error of atomic operators*
    *Update document requires atomic operators*
        - updateOne(filter, data, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.updateOne({age: 23},{$set : {current: "writing pappers"}});


            Discussion: $set is going to update if current property is there else it will add new property current.
            ```
        - updateMany(filter, data, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.updateMany({},{$set: {deleteAll: "true"}});


            Discussion: {} in the filter criteria will select all the documents in the collection.
            ```
        - update(filter, data, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.update({age: 23}, {current: "writing pappers"});


            Discussion: Here in udpate $set is not used and the output of the query will rewrite whole object of rutvik and will only place current and _id property.
            ```
        - replaceOne(filter, data, options)
    
    - **Delete**
        - deleteOne(filter, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.deleteOne({address: 'Gadge Nagar'});

            Discussion: If there are multiple documents with address: 'Gadge Nagar', deleteOne will only delete the first document if found with given filter criteria.
            ```
        - deleteMany(filter, options)
            ```
            db.userInfo.deleteMany({deleteAll: 'true'});


            Discussion: Here in filter criteria we have added deleteAll property which willselect all the documents in the collection.
            ```
- **find method and cursor object**
    - find() actually does not gives you all the data instead it will give you the cursor object and through that cursor you can get the details. cursor object is a iterable i.e mongoDB has multiple methods by default attached to it.
        ```
        db.userInfo.find().toArray();
        db.userInfo.find().forEach((user)=>printjson(user));


        Discussion: toArray() will give you all the data, forEach has capability to iterate over userInfo and give you the result what is required.
        ```
        - There are multiple methods that find gives us you can find them *https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/*

- **Projection**
    - With the help of find we will get all the data suppose we need specific properties from the object at that time we can use projections.
        ```
        db.userInfo.find({},{userName: 1, age: 1, _id:0});


        Discussion: The result of the query will contain userName and age properties of all the documents stored in the userInfo collection. By default _id will be there and if you don't want it then you can exclude it from the result with the help of _id: 0.
        ```
- **Embedded Documents**
    ```
    db.userInfo.updateMany({},{$set: {addMoreDetails:{exactAddress:{addr:'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603'}, pin: 444603, areaCode: 0721}}});
    db.userInfo.find().pretty();

    <!-- output -->
    [
    {
        _id: ObjectId("6465fb90eb1fa143afa0b716"),
        userName: 'ankita',
        age: 29,
        address: 'Gadge Nagar',
        addMoreDetails: {
        exactAddress: { addr: 'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603' },
        pin: 444603,
        areaCode: 465
        }
    },
    {
        _id: ObjectId("6465fb90eb1fa143afa0b717"),
        userName: 'rutvik',
        age: 23,
        address: 'Gadge Nagar',
        addMoreDetails: {
        exactAddress: { addr: 'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603' },
        pin: 444603,
        areaCode: 465
        }
    }
    ]
    ```

- **Adding Array**
    ```
    db.userInfo.updateOne({userName:"rutvik"}, {$set: {intrest: ["running", "time-pass"]}});

    <!-- output -->
    [
    {
        _id: ObjectId("6465fb90eb1fa143afa0b716"),
        userName: 'ankita',
        age: 29,
        address: 'Gadge Nagar',
        addMoreDetails: {
        exactAddress: { addr: 'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603' },
        pin: 444603,
        areaCode: 465
        }
    },
    {
        _id: ObjectId("6465fb90eb1fa143afa0b717"),
        userName: 'rutvik',
        age: 23,
        address: 'Gadge Nagar',
        addMoreDetails: {
        exactAddress: { addr: 'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603' },
        pin: 444603,
        areaCode: 465
        },
        intrest: [ 'running', 'time-pass' ]
    }
    ]
    ```
- **Accessing Structured Data**
    ```
    db.userInfo.findOne({userName: 'rutvik'}).intrest

    <!-- output -->
    [ 'running', 'time-pass' ]
    ```

    ```
    db.userInfo.findOne({intrest: 'running'})

    <!-- output -->
    {
    _id: ObjectId("6465fb90eb1fa143afa0b717"),
    userName: 'rutvik',
    age: 23,
    address: 'Gadge Nagar',
    addMoreDetails: {
        exactAddress: { addr: 'Gadge Nagar near radhakrishna temple amravati, 444603' },
        pin: 444603,
        areaCode: 465
    },
    intrest: [ 'running', 'time-pass' ]
    }
    ```
- Databases and collections are created lazily i.e when you insert any document then and then only the databases and collections are created.
