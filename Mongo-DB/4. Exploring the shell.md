    - when we are using **insertOne** at that time if something fails in the middle then whole document will get rolled backed i.e, the record will not get inserted.
    - If we are using **insertMany** at that time if something fails in the middle then the objects till the point issue happened will get inserted into the collections other will removed or will not get added in the collection.
