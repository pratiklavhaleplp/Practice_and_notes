### Read Operation and Projection
- **Query Operators**: Helps to locate the data this operators will not change the data. Ex: $eq
    - **Comparision**
        - **$eq** Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                runtime : {
                    $eq: 60
                }
            });
            ```
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                "network.country.name":{
                    $eq:'United States'
                }
            });

            Discussion: You can see that we are checking embedded fields as given in above example.
            ```
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                genres: ['Drama']
            });

            Discussion: Here we have queried geners array. If genres having only Drama then you will get the Only-Only Drama in the array data result.
            ```
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                genres: 'Drama'
            });

            Discussion: Here we will get all the details of genres array with Drama included maybe it might contain other elements as well.
            ```
        - **$gt** Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                runtime : {
                    $gt: 60
                }
            });
            ```
        - **$gte** Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
            ```
            db.movies.find({

            });
            ```

                runtime : {
                    $in: [40,60]
                }
            });

            Discussion: pull only 40 and 60 runtime data set only.
            ```
        - **$lt** Matches values that are less than a specified value.
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                runtime : {
                    $lt: 60
                }
            });
            ```
        - **$lte** Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
            ```

                    $lte: 60
                }

            ```
        - **$ne** Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
            ```
            db.movies.find({

                    $ne: 60
                }
            });
            ```
        - **$nin** Matches none of the values specified in an array.
            ```
            db.movies.find({
                runtime : {
                    $in: [40,60]
                }
            });

            Discussion: pull all the data set other than 40 and 60 runtime.
            ```
    - **Evaluation**
        - **regex**
            ```
            db.find.movies({
                summary: {
                    $regex : /musical/
                }
            })
            ```
        - **expr**
            ```
            db.sales.find({
                $expr: {
                    $gt:[
                        "$volume",
                        "$target"
                    ]
                }
            });

            Discussion: volume and target are the two properties of the document in the collection and we are finding all the documents where volume is greater than the target. $expr helps us to evaluate the data on the basis of property values.
            ```
            ```
            db.sales.find({
                $expr: {

                        {
                            $cond: {
                                if: {
                                    $gte: ["$volume", 190]
                                },
                                then: {
                                    $subtract: ["$volume", 10]
                                },
                                else: "$volume"
                            }
                        },
                        "$target"
                    ]
                }
            });

            Discussion: find greater than among the "condition result" and "target". Now Condition is ->
            If volume is greateer than or equal to 190 
                - then subtract volume by 10 and still if it is greater then "target" then select the document.
            Else simple select the document for comparision with the target.


            In simple words $cond will give you "$volume" at the end and then compare it with the $target. If "$volume" is greater then select that document.
            ```

            We are getting 4 as count value.

    - **Array**
        ```

            Discussion: This will specifically check that inside one embedded object of an array there should be name and freq greater than 5

    - **Element**
        - **$exist**

    - **Comments**
    - **Geospatial**
- **Understanding Cursors**
    ```
    const cur = db.movies.find();
    cur.forEach(doc => printjson(doc)); // This will give you all the results.
    ```
    - **sorting cursor**
        - db.movies.find().sort({"rating.average": 1}).pretty(); //asc
        - db.movies.find().sort({"rating.average": -1}).pretty();//dsc
    - **skip and limit**
        - db.movies.find().limit(10); // wil give you 10 records at a time. If you call this once again you will get next 10 data from the movies.
        - db.movies.find().skip(100); // will skip first hundred and send you the result
- **Projection Operators**: Helps to modify presentation and projection operators will not change the data.
    ```
    db.movies.find({},{genres: 1, "network.country.timezone": 1, _id: 0});

    - **$**

            _id: 0
        });

        Discussion: "genres.$": 1 specifies that give me the first match of genres = 'Drama' and in result only add that.
        ```
    - **$eleMatch**

        Discussion: Get all the documents with genres is Drama and from those document only project those document inside which we are having genres = 'Horror' and do not project _id in the output.
        ```
    - **$meta**
    - **$slice**
        ```

        Discussion: Get all the documents with genres is Drama and from those documents only project genres with two elements, name and remove _id.

        Discussion: Get all the documents with genres is Drama and from those documents only project genres by skipping first element and then put next two elemets from the array, name and remove _id.
