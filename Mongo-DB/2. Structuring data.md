- Resseting your database
    - db.dropDatabase() --> will drop your database
    - db.collectionName.drop() --> will drop your collection with collectionName
- **Data Types**
    - **Text** there is no hard limit on this data type anything you put into "" this will be treated as text in mongoDB. For the whole document the maximum amount of text could be stored upto 16MB.
    - **Boolean** true/false
    - **Number**
        - **Integer(int32)** 32 bits long. 
        - **NumberLong(int64)** 63 bits long.
        - **NumberDecimal** presise 
    - **ObjectId** this is the special data type and because of which proper ordering among the data is happening in mongoDB. ObjectId("abcsd");
    - **ISODate**
    - **TimeStamp**
    - **Embedded Documents**
    - **Arrays**
- db.status(), this will give you the details as given below.

- MongoDB embraces the idea of planing you datastructure based on the retrival of the data on front end. 

- Otions for maintaining the relationships among your data.
    1. Nested/Embedded Documents
        - sample document
        ```
        {
            userName: "pratik",
            age: "27",
            address: {
                street: "palash line",
                city: "amravati",
                pin: 444603
            }
        }
        ```
    2. References
        - sample problematic document
        ```
        [
            {
            userName: "pratik",
            favBooks: [{...}, {...}]
            }
        ]

        Discussion: There might be users those having same books as their favourite one. Above data-structure of collection will lead us to redundancy.

            Discussion: As you can see there might be the case that multiple users will have same intrest and keeping same information multiple times is a redundancy.
